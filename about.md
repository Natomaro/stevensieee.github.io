We are the Stevens Institute of Technology branch of IEEE. We enable students to pursue hardware and software projects outside of the classroom and provide opportunities for professional development.

This year we will be emphasizing hobby electronics as a major component of our organization. We provide an environment for students of any major to dive into projects at any level, developing skills along the way that they don't necessarily acquire in class.
